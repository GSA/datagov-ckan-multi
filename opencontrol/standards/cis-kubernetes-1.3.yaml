  description: >-
    *Description*
    Disable anonymous requests to the API server.
    *Rationale*
    When enabled, requests that are not rejected by other configured
    authentication methods are treated as anonymous requests. These requests are
    then served by the API server. You should rely on authentication to
    authorize access and disallow anonymous requests. If you are using RBAC
    authorization, it is generally considered reasonable to allow anonymous
    access to the API Server for health checks and discovery purposes, and hence
    this recommendation is not scored. However, you should consider whether
    anonymous discovery is an acceptable risk for your purposes.

'cis-kubernetes-1.1.2':
  family: '1'
  name: Ensure that the --basic-auth-file argument is not set
  description: >-
    *Description*
    Do not use basic authentication.
    *Rationale*
    Basic authentication uses plaintext credentials for authentication.
    Currently, the basic authentication credentials last indefinitely, and the
    password cannot be changed without restarting API server. The basic
    authentication is currently supported for convenience. Hence, basic
    authentication should not be used.
