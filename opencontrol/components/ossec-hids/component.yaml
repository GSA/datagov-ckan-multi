      The GSA IT Security Operations provides a rationale for adequacy of the auditable
      events for GSA to support after-the-fact investigations of security incidents,
      per CIO P2100.1I Chapter 5(3); “Security Procedural Guide Auditing & Monitoring,
      OCIO-IT Security-01-08”.  In order to fully understand and track an attacker
      through logs certain items (attributes) must be captured within each log so
      that multiple logs can be linked together to track the attackers activities.
      SecTools systems run either Trend Micro Deep Security agents or OSSEC HIDS agents.   Both
      of these agents have log monitoring functions which monitor audit log files,
      parsing them against rulesets and generating events of varying severity.   These
      security agent events are correlated in the Enterprise Logging Platform (SecTools)
      and are used to support after-the-fact security investigations.   The agents
      and correlation in the Enterprise Logging Platform enhance and automate the
      critical audit log identification process. SecTools customers are responsible
      for the installation of Trend and OSSEC security agents when they deploy and
      maintain their systems.  Customers are responsible for coordinating with the
      GSA SecOps team to create initial agent configurations to match their environment
      and keeping agents running.

      The SecTools customer holds a shared responsibility for audit log review.  The
      customer is responsible for reviewing any audit records which the Trend or OSSEC
      security agents do not support.  This will include things like applications
      and databases running on the OS but may also include other information components.  The
      SecTools customer should have their own weekly process for on-system audit record
      review to monitor account and system activity.

      SecTools employs the OSSEC Manager to monitor OS audit logs in real time, feeding
      analysis-based information to dashboards and email alerts communicating to the
      ENS SecOps team.  The ServiceNow ticketing system for reporting suspicious activities
      is used to integrate audit review, analysis, and the reporting processes.

      HA has been deployed in the environment where it is required at this time.   There
      are some tools or systems which SecOps have deemed HA is not required for due
      to compensations from overall enterprise architecture or that other failure
      mitigations are built-in. For OSSEC HA not required at present due to minimal
      use agent event pooling, EBS volume snapshot and restore procedure

      \ other relevant documentation to reflect these changes. OSSEC Managers can\
      \ deploy second OSSEC managers to provide HA.   This has not been implemented\
      \ because OSSEC usage is very light.   At this time it is not necessary to have\
      \ an HA deployment.   EBS volume snapshots are taken multiple times each day\
      \ and OSSEC managers are replaced in the event of failure.   If a manager fails\
      \ log and event data pools on individual hosts and is sent to the manager when\

      The GSA Security Operations team utilizes a combination of Trend Micro Deep
      Security and OSSEC agents to perform HIDS / HIPS services on instances running
      in the SecTools environment.   These agents generate actionable events based
      on rules which trigger when suspicious or malicious activity is detected on
      the host.   Events from these agents are sent to the Enterprise Logging Platform
      (SecTools boundary) for correlation and review of actionable events. GSA Security
      Operations Customers are responsible for utilizing the established VPN tunnels
      for interconnections and appropriately ensuring the secure transmission of all
      HTTPS interfaces.   Customers are responsible for the installation of Trend
      or OSSEC security agents and for keeping them running.   Customers are responsible
      for requesting the creation of Trend firewall policies and changes to them.   These
      changes should be submitted using the Firewall Change Request option in GSA’s
      Service Catalog available in ServiceNow.   Customers are responsible for working
      with the SecOps team to troubleshoot agent issues when notified of them by SecOps.
