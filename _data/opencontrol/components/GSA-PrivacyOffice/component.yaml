      The GSA ISP is responsible for determining and documenting the legal authority
      permitting the handling of GSA PII.  Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. §552a (e) (3) GSA
      provides what is commonly referred to as a Privacy Act Statement to all persons
      asked to provide personal information about themselves, which will go into a
      system of records [i.e., the information will be stored and retrieved using
      the individual’s name or other personal identifier such as a Social Security
      Number (SSN)]. GSA policy is to provide a Privacy Act Statement regardless of
      whether the collection is part of a system of records or not. All Privacy Act
      statements must be reviewed by the GSA Privacy Office. When drafting a Privacy
      Act Statement for review by the GSA Privacy Office, the legal authority for
      collecting the information (statute, executive order, regulation, etc.) is included.
