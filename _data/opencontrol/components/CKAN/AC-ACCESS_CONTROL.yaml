      CKAN’s authorization system controls which users are allowed to
      carry out which actions on the site. All actions that users can
      carry out on a CKAN site are controlled by the authorization
      system. For example, the authorization system controls who can
      register new user accounts, delete user accounts, or create,
      edit and delete datasets, groups and organizations.

      CKAN provides user accounts for individuals who participate in visiting, contributing
      to and administering the site with the following roles:

      • Anonymous user – readers of the site who either do not have an account or
      are not logged in.

      • Organizational member - This role inherits anonymous user permissions, and also can view
      an organization's private datasets.

      • Organizational editor - This role inherits organizational member permissions, and can also
      add new datasets to the organization, and edit or delete existing organizational datasets.

      • Organizational administrator - This role inherits organizational editor permissions,
      and can also manage the user membership of an organization, make datasets public or private, and
      edit information about the organization itself.

      • Administrator - This role has all permissions enabled by default.

      CKAN has a sophisticated permissions and role-based access control built in.
      Each role within CKAN can only access the documents and controls for which
      their privilege allows.

      Access control in CKAN is enforced by authentication via unique username/password
      for every type of user except Anonymous user. The user’s privileges, permissions
      and access are provided on "least privilege" principle.

      The anonymous user role has the least access to the site of all roles. The website
      does not allow anonymous users to register an account for themselves. CKAN
      Administrators are the only user roles that can create new user accounts.

      At the application layer, CKAN is designed with a role based user access system,
      a least privileged approach based on assignment of privileges to roles. CKAN‘s
      permission systems enables control of what users can do and see on the site.
      The user roles mentioned in control AC-5 define a specific set of permission for
      each role.

      All team accounts are audited quarterly based on the concept of least privilege. Each member of the developer team is assigned a role which defines access
      needed to perform only the member’s job function.  The audit of accounts is reported and reviewed by the operations team and evaluated to determine whether
      roles or membership within the developer team should be changed.

      Lock down following unsuccessful attempts is configurable by CKAN administrators
      to conform to defined requirements.  When a user exceeds the limit of invalid
      logon attempts, their account is automatically locked for a specfied time and
      requires administrator action to unlock the account before the lockout period
      expires.
