      The boundary for the BSP, both external and internal, are visually represented
      within the VPC boundary diagram within Section 9 of the BSP SSP.  To enhance
      the monitoring performed by GSA Security, the BSP, for both the internal and
      external boundary communications, additional monitoring takes place within Splunk.  Splunk
      captures all of the NetScaler, TrendMicro, AWS ELB, and AWS Flow logs which
      are used to enhance monitoring for unapproved or unexpected network activity.

      External Boundaries:

      To enhance the GSA Security firewall boundary protection and monitoring, BSP
      implements Network Access Control lists within AWS.  These are used to tightly
      control access for VPN traffic between VPC’s as well as VPN connections between
      the GSA OCIO network and BSP.

      Internal Boundaries

      Key internal traffic is controlled through the use of  security groups which
      act as internal firewalls and restrict, based on a whitelist, to only approved
      services and ports communications capabilities between these internal boundaries.

      on the back side of the firewall are contained within private subnets.  All
      components within the Production, Test, Dev, and Lab environments, with the
      exception of the firewalls, are assigned to internal private IP spaces.
