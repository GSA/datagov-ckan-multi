      Twistlock has added updating their API authentication mechanism to their development road map. 
      While this feature is under development, the entire API exchange will occur behind a VPN to provide secure API calls. 
      In addition, every account that accesses the API creates syslogs entries that integrates with the SecOps ELK stack. 
      Accounts and or the associated certificates actions can be logged and tracked. 
      Dashboards can be created to monitor for abnormal API activity. 
      Upon delivery of updated Twistlock capabilities, GSA SecOps will implement the updates to improve the API security posture.

      Twistlock provides vulnerability information to developers as they deploy container images within their system.  
      SecTools Twistlock customers must remediate vulnerabilities identified by Twistlock prior to deploying their images, and vulnerability remediation should be carried out inline with GSA IT Security Policies.  
      In some cases Twistlock policy may reject the deployment of containers due to vulnerabilities. 
      SecTools Twistlock customers must integrate their microservices architecture to use the Twistlock daemon and proxy as specified by the requirements found at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zXpKoMd8qJx3ALULNRgnJL3GwLojAiqCXW8LxRbU5ZA.
