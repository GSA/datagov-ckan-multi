      Data.gov has the following types of users:

      Public users do not need an account to access data or provide comments or ask
      questions.

      General users (mostly agency open data leads) could have the following access:

      WordPress editing privileges for Data.gov Topics content

      Admin access to catalog.data.gov (CKAN) to control their catalog harvesting

      A separate CKAN instance, called inventory.data.gov, allows agencies that use
      that system to manage their metadata access to that agency’s metadata only.
      Agency users can be either admin or editor on inventory.data.gov, to the agency’s
      own metadata.

      Data.gov PMO members have admin access to the application (WordPress, CKAN)
      in order to edit the content on the Data.gov site and also grant privileges
      to the CKAN applications to agency users.
  - key: b
    text: For general users, i.e. the agency open data leads, they must first have
      an account through the OMB MAX system, which requires a .gov email address.
      After a MAX account is created, the general user sends an email to the Data.gov
      PMO requesting the particular permission-whether it is editing content, managing
      a data harvest source, or using inventory.data.gov. The Data.gov PMO confirms
      the required access and then sets the applicable permissions in WordPress or
      CKAN.
  - key: c

      For general users (agency open data leads), the Data.gov PMO sets the conditions
      for granting access. The agency open data leads are generally well-known to
      the Data.gov PMO through past interaction on Data.gov issues and regular biweekly
      meetings held with the Data.gov PMO, OMB, and the open data leads. For editing
      content on Data.gov (WordPress), permissions are limited to the Data.gov PMO
      and a very small number of agency open data leads who have a need to regularly
      edit content on topic pages for which they remain responsible for maintaining
      current content. For managing data harvest sources (catalog.data.gov), access
      is limited to agency open data leads who require access to harvest sources for
      changing harvest frequency or running a manual harvest. On inventory.data.gov,
      accounts are limited to the agencies that choose to use inventory.data.gov for
      metadata management, and the specific individuals from that agency that require
      access to the system to manage their agency’s metadata. The determination of
      access to inventory.data.gov is made by the Data.gov PMO  working with agency
      open data leads who determine which individuals at their agencies need  access
      to inventory.data.gov.

      Any user with privileged access to Data.gov, whether general user (agency lead)
      or application administrator (Data.gov PMO members and support contractors),
      first have to authenticate through the OMB MAX system. The MAX system requires
      each user to register a .gov email address. Once a user has authenticated through
      MAX, the user requests the privileges from the Data.gov PMO. Currently, the
      application administrator accounts are limited to three Data.gov government
      employees: hyon.kim@gsa.gov, philip.ashlock@gsa.gov, john.jediny@gsa.gov, and
      the Data.gov technical support contractors from REI Systems, Inc., who access
      the system through their gsa.gov email addresses (and OMB MAX).

      For general users (agency open data leads), users must first obtain an OMB MAX

      documented through a private GitHub repository as the ticketing system.

      General users (agency open data leads) request accounts on Data.gov/catalog.data.gov/inventory.data.gov
      by contacting the Data.gov PMO. The Data.gov PMO determines whether the agency
      user requires the particular access and grants the permissions in WordPress
      or CKAN. The Data.gov PMO periodically reviews and confirms the access lists
      with the agency open data leads and removes any accounts that are no longer
      needed. Agencies can also contact Data.gov PMO to request deletions or changes
      to access, as when there is a change in personnel. Review and changes to access
      are maintained via email and documented through a private GitHub repository.
  - key: g

      Changes to general users such as addition, deletion, or change in access are
      initiated by the agencies through email to the Data.gov PMO.  OMB MAX has a
      role in the account monitoring process. The OMB MAX System Administrator monitors
      the use of accounts (for failed login, unauthorized access). The MAX system
      handles the account lockout process for unused accounts and password failures.
      Additionally, within the WordPress portion of Data.gov there is an additional
      audit plugin that allows the application to monitor user access activity and
      records that activity in a log file.

      For general users (agency open data leads), when a federal user separates from
      their agency, the agency is responsible for notifying the Data.gov PMO via email
      to ensure the user’s access roles are removed from Data.gov. The Data.gov PMO
      is responsible for removing the user account and access to the application.
      Termination of the MAX account is handled at the MAX system level.

      For general users (agency open data leads), they must first be approved and
      have an account through OMB MAX, which requires a current .gov email address.
      Once the general user has a MAX account, the user requests the applicable permission
      from the Data.gov PMO, which approves the access as needed. For WordPress, the
      Data.gov PMO limits access to a small number of open data leads who need to
      maintain content on one of the topic pages that is active on Data.gov. For the
      catalog, the Data.gov PMO determines whether the general user manages a data
      harvest source that requires access to the catalog admin functions for managing
      the harvest schedule. For inventory.data.gov, the Data.gov PMO determines whether
      the user is from an agency using inventory.data.gov for managing its metadata.
      The Data.gov PMO works with the lead from each agency for any additional users
      of the inventory.data.gov system.

      Before accessing any privileged functions on Data.gov, the general user has
      to authenticate through OMB MAX. The MAX system reviews system accounts for
      compliance and completes an annual user recertification to ensure access to
      MAX is still required. The Data.gov PMO also conducts an annual user recertification
      process to ensure that general users from the agencies still require the applicable
      access to Data.gov.

      Data.gov has processes to follow the principle of least privilege. On the WordPress
      application, privileged access is limited to the Data.gov PMO members and a
      small number of agency users (<5) who regularly update content on their topic
      areas on Data.gov. On catalog.data.gov, the practice is to not grant accounts
      to agency users in most cases, as agencies that simply host data.json files
      for contributing metadata to the Data.gov catalog have no need for admin access
      to the catalog. Catalog access is limited to a smaller number of agency users
      that require admin access to set harvesting frequencies for geospatial harvest
      sources. On inventory.data.gov, access is limited to only those agencies that
      choose to use inventory.data.gov for managing their metadata. Inventory.data.gov
      is designed so that agencies can only access the metadata that agency maintains
      in the system, not any other agency’s data. Privileged access is limited to
      Editor for most users, with a smaller number of agency users (usually the open
      data lead), with admin access to their agency’s metadata on the system.

      Manage.data.gov access is integrated with OMB MAX MFA and is also associated

      PMO can assign individuals access.  Any user logged into  Manage.data.gov will
      not be able to see the Dashboard, unless they are associated with the GSA administration
      group in the MAX system.  Currently manage.data.gov is accessible only within
      the GSA network,  which is another added layer of security to view the dashboard.

      New Relic access to view Data.gov applications’ data is managed by the GSA IT
      Team, and is not part of Data.gov scope.  Manage.data.gov (Kibana/Fluentd/Elasticsearch)

      The number of privileged users on Data.gov applications is limited. On the WordPress
      site, there are approximately 20  accounts with access to post and edit content,
      consisting mainly of the Data.gov PMO and a few agency leads of Data.gov topics.
      Accounts on catalog.data.gov are limited. For most agencies with data.json files
      for their metadata inventories, the harvest location of their metadata is fixed
      at agency.gov/data.json and there is no need for the agency open data leads
      to have accounts on catalog.data.gov. For geospatial data sources, agency leads
      can have privileged access to manage the harvest source of that agency. The
      account does not permit the agency lead to do anything else on catalog.data.gov.
      For agencies using inventory.data.gov, the users are limited to their own agency’s
      metadata, and do not have privileges to affect metadata belonging to any other
      agency.

      14 Privacy Controls

      This section describes the privacy controls in place and planned for the system.
      This section covers authority and purpose (AP), accountability, audit, and risk
      management (AR), data quality and integrity (DI), data minimization and retention
      (DM), individual participation and redress (IP), security (SE), transparency
      (TR) and use limitation (UL) controls.

      Note: If the system does not use, collect, transmit, or maintain privacy data
      this section can be removed from the SSP. The system’s PIA must support this
      determination.
