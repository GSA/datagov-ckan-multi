# Welcome!

We're so glad you're thinking about contributing to a [open source project of the U.S. government](https://code.gov/)! If you're unsure about anything, just ask -- or submit the issue or pull request anyway. The worst that can happen is you'll be politely asked to change something. We love all friendly contributions.

We encourage you to read this project's CONTRIBUTING policy (you are here), its [LICENSE](LICENSE.md), and its [README](README.md).

## Team principles


### Release Engineering

Data.gov follows the four principles of modern [Release
Engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Release_engineering):

* **Identifiability** Being able to identify all of the source, tools,
  environment, and other components that make up a particular release.
* **Reproducibility** The ability to integrate source, third party components,
  data, and deployment externals of a software system in order to guarantee
  operational stability.
* **Consistency** The mission to provide a stable framework for development,
  deployment, audit, and accountability for software components.
* **Agility** The ongoing research into what are the repercussions of modern
  software engineering practices on the productivity in the software cycle, i.e.
  continuous integration.


### Application development

Additionally, Data.gov is made up of several applications. We strive to maintain
independence of these applications from the underlying Platform.

- Applications follow the [Twelve-Factor Methodology](https://12factor.net).
- The Platform exposes services to applications.
- Deployment of each Application is independent from the deployment of the Platform.


## Sprint rituals

We follow two week sprints with the following rituals.

- Biweekly standup (Alternate Mondays and every Thursday)
- Sprint planning (first Monday of the sprint)
- Sprint review (end of the sprint)
- Sprint retrospective (once every two sprints)


## Story lifecycle

**Stories** represent tactical increments of individually-valuable work
deliverable by the team within a single iteration... often an isolated change in
functionality aimed at achieving a goal for a particular kind of stakeholder,
whether customer, user, or operator/admin. Stories are tracked on the [Kanban
Board](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/datagov-multi-tenant-ckan-5cf12b601437ff1e943f0aa2/board?repos=153296282)
and progress through these columns.

- New issues
- Icebox
- Backlog
- Needs spec
- Upcoming sprint
- Current sprint
- Blocked
- In progress
- QA
- Closed


### Definition of "Done"

An agile "Definition of Done" (DoD) captures the team's agreed-upon standards
for how we get work done at a consistent level of quality. Having a DoD ensures
that non-functional requirements (NFRs) don't have to be re-litigated for every
piece of work taken on, cards can be focused on just the relevant details, and
new team members aren't surprised by assumed expectations of their colleagues.

At our sprint reviews, we demo work that has reached the "Done" column and is of
interest to our users or teammates.


#### Column exit criteria

Our DoD is broken up into a set of statements that should be true
for each card before it moves to the next column on the board.

Before advancing a card from one column to the next on the board, it should meet
the "exit criteria" for the current column, which are listed below.


### Columns


#### New issues

New issues that need to be triaged.


##### Exit criteria

- Relevant points from any discussion in the comments is captured in the initial
  post.
- Decision is made to move to the Backlog or Icebox columns, or close.


#### Icebox

Work that has been de-prioritized.


##### Exit criteria

- When reviewing priorities, we may pull items out of the Icebox.
- Items move to Product backlog for grooming.


#### Backlog

Work that we are planning on doing but haven't groomed or scheduled.


##### Exit criteria

- Indicate the intended benefit and who the story is for in the "as a ..., I want
  ..., so that ..." form.


#### Needs spec

Work that needs grooming before we can schedule it.


##### Exit criteria

- Acceptance criteria is defined.
- If necessary, the story includes a security testing plan and any tasks from
  that plan are included as acceptance criteria.
- Level of effort has been estimated and set in terms of story points.


#### Upcoming sprint

Work we are queuing up for the next sprint. Work in this column should be
well-defined and ready to begin work.


##### Exit criteria

- During sprint planning, work is reviewed with the team and any questions or
  clarifications are made.
- No info or assistance is needed from outside the team to start work and likely
  finish it.


#### Current sprint

Work that we are planning for the current sprint, waiting for a team member to
pick it up.


##### Exit criteria

- There's capacity available to work on the story (e.g., this column is a buffer
  of shovel-ready work).


#### Blocked

Work that has been started but is blocked by an external party and needs
occasional nudging to get it unblocked.


##### Exit criteria

- Third-party blocker has been removed, the story can move to Sprint backlog or
  In progress.


#### In progress (WIP limit: 2/person)

Work that is currently in progress.


##### Exit criteria

- Acceptance criteria are demonstrably met.
- Relevant tasks complete, irrelevant checklists removed or captured on a new
  story.
- Follows documented coding conventions.
- Application and test code is linted as part of Continuous Integration.
  - Ansible (ansible-lint, flake8 provided by molecule)
  - Python (flake8)
  - Bash (TBD)
  - PHP (TBD)
- Automated tests have been added and are included in Continuous Integration.
- Pair-programmed or peer-reviewed (e.g., use pull-requests).
- Test coverage exists and overall coverage hasn't been reduced.
- User-facing and internal operation docs have been updated.
- Demoable to other people in their own time (e.g. user acceptance testing (UAT)
  environment, published branch).
- Any deployment is repeatable (e.g., at least documented to increase bus factor
  beyond one) and if possible automated via CI/CD.
- If the deployment is difficult to automate, then a story for making it automated is created at the top of New Issues.
- The deployment must follow our Configuration Management plan. If not possible,
  contact the Program Management team to modify the story or discuss how to
  update the Configuration Management plan.


#### QA

Work is ready for QA.

##### Exit criteria

- Reviewer asserts the Acceptance Criteria
- Any issues or questions are raised and discussed. If low effort can be done to
  resolve, the story should move to In Progress or Current Sprint. Otherwise,
  additional issues are created in New.


#### Done

Task has been applied to production and is considered done and should be reviewed with the team as part of the Sprint Review.


##### Exit criteria

- The work is user-visible and announceable at any time.
- The work has been demoed at the Sprint Review.


#### Closed

Task is done and has been reviewed by the team as part of Sprint Review.


##### Exit criteria

- GitHub issue is marked Closed.


## Security Practices

Security should be treated as part of development, and not as an
afterthought.  We integrate security practices into our work and
pipelines, "shifting left" and automating whenever possible.

### Use of branch protection

Branch protection affords the following advantages:

- branch commit history cannot be rewritten
- pushes to significant branches can be restricted to a subset of maintainers
- merges to protected branches can require a status check (e.g., passing tests, pull request reviews, etc.)

Both GitHub and GitLab have support for protected branches:

- https://help.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/configuring-protected-branches
- https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/protected_branches.html

#### Recommendations

- Enable branch protection on master (or any deployable branch.)
- Enable "require pull request reviews before merging" on master
- Enable require automated CI and security checks to pass before merging

### Static vulnerability detection in application dependencies

By inspecting dependencies for known vulnerabilties, we can prevent
the unintended injection of security issues.

#### Recommendations

- As a precursor to static vulnerability detection, application
  dependencies should be frozen so that builds can be repeatable.  For
  Python applications, *pip freeze* can be used to generate a frozen
  requirements file.  Using tools such as *pip-compile* (from
  [pip-tools](https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools/)),
  [pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv), or
  [poetry](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry) can also be used
  to both manage dependences and generate frozen requirements.
- Use a vulnerability scanner such as
  [safety](https://github.com/pyupio/safety-db) or
  [snyk](https://snyk.io)

### Static code analysis

Static code analysis can help find security issues in code before deployment.

#### Recommendations

- For Python code, we recommend the
  [Bandit](https://bandit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) security linter.
- A static code analysis should be run as part of the CI/CD pipeline on every pull request.
- See https://github.com/drydockcloud/ci-bandit for an example integration of Bandit into a Docker image, which simplifies use from a CI/CD pipeline.


## Pull requests

Developers should feel empowered to review each others code, even if you're not
an expert on a particular application or feature. Any developer on the team can
review any PR.

What should you do when you review a PR?

- Review the code for quality and consistency
- Call out any breaking changes
- Assert the **Definition of Done** (above) is met
  - Tests are written and running in CI
  - Documentation is written, if applicable
  - Code is in a deployable state

Any critical CI checks should be enforced by GitHub on protected branches
(`master`), so it's not required that CI checks are passing in
order to approve a PR. Instead, it's important that tests have been added and
they are running in CI.

Data.gov encompasses many technologies (too many, in fact) and it's not
practical to have everyone be an expert at everything nor to have only a single
expert review all code in a specific domain e.g. PHP. Any developer should be
able to follow the README in order to get a working system and should post on
the PR if that doesn't seem to be the case.

Ideally, our tests should give us good confidence that changes are working
correctly. Even though that is currently not the case (we are working on
building up our test coverage), it's not required to try out the code locally.

If approved, you may merge immediately or leave it to the author. A single
approval is all that is needed to merge.
